## About the Project
This project focuses on building a modern layout using **Flexbox**. The design includes a header, a hero section, an information section with cards, a quote section, and a call-to-action footer.

### Built With
*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   Flexbox

### Key Features
*   **Flexbox Layouts:** Used extensively for aligning items in the header, hero section, and card containers.
*   **Responsive Cards:** The information section uses `flex: 1` to ensure cards remain equal width and responsive.
*   **Semantic HTML:** Structured using proper tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
*   **Clean CSS:** Utilized a separate stylesheet with organized classes.
